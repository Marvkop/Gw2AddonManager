# Gw2AddonManager
I am not associated with Guildwars 2 or Arenanet or any of the supported addons.

This is just a little personal side-project by me and not intended to be "THE ONE AND ONLY" addon manager.

Use at your own risk if you want to.

Implemented with WPF in C#.

## Currently supported addons:

- arc_dps
- arcdps_unofficial_extras
- arcdps_healing_stats
- arcdps-killproof.me-plugin
- GW2-ArcDPS-Boon-Tabl

Could currently easily support all addons that release on github as .dll
