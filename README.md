# Gw2AddonManager
Personal addon manager for Guildwars 2.
Implemented with WPF in C#.

This is just a little personal side-project by me and not intended to be "THE ONE AND ONLY" addon manager.
Use at your own risk if you want to.

Currently supported addons:

- arc_dps
- arcdps_unofficial_extras
- arcdps_healing_stats
- arcdps-killproof.me-plugin
- GW2-ArcDPS-Boon-Tabl
